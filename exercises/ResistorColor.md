# Resistor Color

**Intern should*...*  
write two methods  
    - *ColorCode*, which gets a color and returns an integer associated with that color.  
    - *Colors* which returns an array of strings!

## Notes

- Intern has to search over an array in some way. They may end up using *Array.IndexOf* or *Array.FindIndex*

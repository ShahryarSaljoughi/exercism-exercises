# Circular Buffer

**Intern should*...*  
As the name implies, implement a generic class behaving as a circular buffer!

## Notes

- Some sort of collection is needed. `queue` suits best for this exercise.
- throwing exception is needed.
- Code contains a generic class and intern is required to implement generic methods in it.

# Two Fer

**Intern should*...*  
write a method, called *Speak*, which optionally receives a string as parameter and returns another string.

If no parameter is passed, output is : `One for you, one for me.`  
if X is passed as parameter, output is : `One for X, one for me.`

## Notes

- default values
- [optional arguments](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/named-and-optional-arguments#optional-arguments) can be used. Actually, this exercise is where optional arguments exist to be used in!
- [expression bodied](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/expression-bodied-members#methods) methods can be used.
